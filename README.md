# Guitar Helper

This is a little app I made for my personal use, which has two functionalities:
1. It plays A so that I can tune my guitar while training my ears to look for two sounds with the same pitch
2. It helps me transpose - I'm not good with barre chords yet, so I often use the help of capo for easier chords - 
  the songs I generally play are 4 chords repeated, so I simply made the app transpose 4 notes (since putting more would complicate
   the transposition process, rendering the point of this app useless for me) for me to look at while practicing guitar
